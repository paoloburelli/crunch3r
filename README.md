##### High speed CPU based headless 3D library

The library is intended for headless 3D caclulations (e.g. physics or AI).
It is an object oriented C++ library; However, the library is designed so that the data crunching functions are all contained in a C-style library which can be used as a base for other languages (e.g. C# or Java).
The library compiles by defeult with SSE3 support (this can be disabled) and it is designed to use multi-threading to exploit multi-core/multi-cpu stystems.
